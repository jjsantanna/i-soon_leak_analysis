    "##### Findings:\n",
    "1. **Finding:**: The company tends to focus on Asian targets, particularly those in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, and India. However, leaked chat records also contain references to Western nations. In several instances, employees discuss the sale of data from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the UK Foreign Office.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: What countries/organizations were targeted or planned to be targeted by I-Soon?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding:**: The most intriguing relationship highlighted in the leak is the connection between iSoon and APT41 (also known as Double Dragon, Wicked Panda, Bronze Atlas). APT41 is considered one of China’s most sophisticated and persistent threat actors, having been linked to a string of high-profile supply chain attacks and espionage operations since about 2014.\n",

    "Standard version can be used to crack WiFi passwords, LAN port sniffing, establish a SOCKS tunnel, port projection, remote shell, file management, and remote detonation \n",
    "Mini version can be disguised as a power strip or adapter. It can connect to target WiFi and establish a SOCKS tunnel with the internal network. [21]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: Did I-Soon create a tool for WiFi Near Field Attack Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding:**:\n",
    "Automated Penetration Testing Platform \n",
    "Scans to find vulnerabilities and exploit these.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: Did I-Soon have a tool to automatically penetrate test networks for vulnerabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source 2: \n",
    "https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/i-soon-leak-kelas-insights/\n",
    "##### Findings:\n",
    "1. **Finding:**: The majority of I-Soon’s clients were Chinese provincial- and city-level government bodies, most of which were local public security bureaus. I-Soon was a certified provider for the Ministry of Public Security in China. \n",

    "    **Hypothesis**: Did I-Soon work with government bodies?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding:**: Multiple malware applications like Twitter/xStealer, custom Remote Access Trojans (RATs) for Windows and Linux, and iOS/Android device exploitations \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: What kind of services did I-Soon offer? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding:**: The repository contains 577 files, including: records of text conversations between employees; employee information and lists of companies attacked by I-Soon\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: what did the leaked files contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source 3: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Source 4: \n",
    "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news-features/isoon-github-leak-chinese-cyber/\n",
    "#### Findings:\n",
    "1. **Finding:**: According to Will Thomas, a threat researcher at Equinix, he was relatively sure the data was legit. “Based on the level of detail, leaked chat logs, amount of data, and corroboration from overlaps indicators of compromise (IOCs), I have medium-to-high confidence it is legit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: Was the data leaked from I-Soon legit?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding:**: Although the source of the leak is unknown, cybersecurity vendor Malwarebyte believes the leak came from an unhappy employee of I-Soon. It could have been a revengeful ex-employee, a rival Chinese contractor, a foreign intelligence agency or another Chinese cybercriminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Hypothesis**: Where did the leak come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source 5: \n",
    "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-41-group\n",
    "#### Findings:\n",
    "1. **Finding:**: ZHANG Haoran, TAN Dailin, QIAN Chuan, FU Qiang, and JIANG Lizhi are all part of a Chinese hacking group known as APT 41 and BARIUM.\n",
    "On August 15, 2019, a Grand Jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment against Chinese nationals ZHANG Haoran and TAN Dailin on charges including Unauthorized Access to Protected Computers, Aggravated Identity Theft, Money Laundering, and Wire Fraud. These charges primarily stemmed from alleged activity targeting high technology and video gaming companies, and a United Kingdom citizen.\n",
    "On August 11, 2020, a Grand Jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment against Chinese nationals QIAN Chuan, FU Qiang, and JIANG Lizhi on multiple charges, including: Racketeering, Money Laundering, Fraud, Identity Theft, and Access Device Fraud. The defendants allegedly conducted supply chain attacks to gain unauthorized access to networks throughout the world, targeting hundreds of companies representing a broad array of industries to include: social media, telecommunications, government, defense, education, and manufacturing. These victims included companies in Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan and Sweden.  The defendants allegedly targeted telecommunications providers in the United States, Australia, China (Tibet), Chile, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. The defendants allegedly deployed ransomware attacks and demanded payments from victims.\n",

In 19 years, my salary is 10200 before tax, year-end took 2.5 months In 20 years, my salary is 11700 before tax (including 200 confidentiality fee) In 17 years, I came to Anxun when the salary is 7500, in Haikang is 8000, I reduce the salary to come to the Anxun, I feel that as long as I work hard, the income is sure to go up. 18 years, the company adjusted me 1,000, went up to 8500, and at the beginning of 19 years, adjusted 20% of the company regulation, went up to 10200. The company stipulated 20%, up to 10200. at that time I think my value was seen by the company, also recognized me. But in 19 years, I think I worked harder than in 18 years, the result of the end of the year and salary adjustment is not as expected, then I did not go to complain or go to spit, I just told myself to use 20 years of performance to prove themselves. 20 years I was promoted to supervisor, whether it is the department's team or personnel recruitment, and daily management, and a variety of projects, a variety of documents, I feel that I 20 years is the busiest, the most tireless year to Anshun, customers have the need, I can do the first time to feedback, customers have problems, I can do the first time to deal with. But found a year of hard work, or nothing. May feel very disappointed and lost, I do not like to express or take credit to prove themselves, I sometimes still want to say in my bones because the ability to OK, so you can match the corresponding income, as well as my passion or enthusiasm can be sustained into the company's business.\n",

      "30, from: lengmo to: just910420 - 2021-03-05 12:05:58: Well, it is understandable, in fact, last year because of the epidemic, the company's overall loss of about 4 million or so, some of the money are not back, like Lhasa and Shaanxi are not paid. But the company still prioritizes the protection of the technical line of colleagues, just all less points. The entire back-office departments and R & D are not a penny!\n",

      "32, from: lengmo to: just910420 - 2021-03-05 12:07:41: The sales side is there because there is a system in place and it makes sense to get a commission for completed results. Those who did not complete will not. Just before the system on the sales before the commission percentage is a little less, this year will be adjusted over\n",
      "33, from: lengmo to: just910420 - 2021-03-05 12:08:10: So the company still favors the tech line as a whole, and look at R&D for a penny. They've been busy all year too.\n",
      "34, from: lengmo to: just910420 - 2021-03-05 12:09:03: Last year there was also the military and Shanghai Zhou Shuai and their team spent money and part of it, so they were all laid off at the end of last year\n",

      "38, from: just910420 to: lengmo - 2021-03-05 12:14:30: Well, in fact, I did not say on the sales commission much of an opinion, just that I a 13 years graduated, working for 7 years of people, a year of income to hand I think and I pay does not match. I also agree with the technical line of work, they are the company to obtain the project of the reliable force, because we An Xun is not a business-oriented company, are relying on technology to win the recognition of customers, so there will be projects, they should get their due.\n",
      "39, from: lengmo to: just910420 - 2021-03-05 12:15:13: A lot of people on the tech line honestly took less than you did at the end of last year\n",

      "45, from: just910420 to: lengmo - 2021-03-05 12:37:28: Mr. C, I can understand. But I also hope that the company can appreciate my feelings, at the end of 19 when the company was thriving, I actually didn't get much, what I got was a salary transfer of 1300 and 2.5 months of year-end. Of course this is my own feel unsatisfied. 20 years, because of the impact of the epidemic, but I also have to do everything seriously, and did not bring my 19 years of dissatisfaction to work. October 4, 20 years is my wedding day, I September 30th is still and pre-sales brothers in Shanghai three listed loaded, get finished after catching the evening flight back to Chengdu, landing back home at 1 am, directly pack up and then drove my girlfriend went to Guizhou side of the mother-in-law's home to pick up they go to my hometown. I really love my job at Anshun, and I often put my job in the first place. I really thank Mr. C for telling me so much, my side of the weekend these two days will be comprehensive consideration, make a final decision.\n",
